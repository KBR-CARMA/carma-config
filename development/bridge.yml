# This file contains explicit topic mappings between ROS1 and ROS2 portions of CARMA Platform while the 
# ROS2 migration is underway.
# NOTE: A custom dynamic_bridge is used in CARMA Platform which will automatically connect topics and services, but 
#       this file allows for certain topics to be pre-configured with specified QoS settings.
